# LLM Skills Repository

This repository is a collection of custom skills for Large Language Models (LLMs) like Gemini-CLI.

## About

Here, I will develop and store various skills that extend the capabilities of my conversational AI assistants. The goal is to create a reusable and organized collection of tools.

## Structure

Each skill is contained in its own directory within the `skills/` folder. For example:

```
skills/
└───sample-skill/
    ├───README.md
    └───...
```

## Usage

Instructions for installing and using each skill can be found in the `README.md` file within the respective skill's directory.

## Contributing

This is a personal collection, but suggestions and ideas are welcome. Feel free to open an issue to discuss potential new skills or improvements.
