# LLM Skills Repository

This repository is a collection of custom skills for Large Language Models (LLMs) like Gemini-CLI.

## About

Here, I will develop and store various skills that extend the capabilities of my conversational AI assistants. The goal is to create a reusable and organized collection of tools.

## Structure

Each skill is contained in its own directory. For example:

```
.
└───non-blocking-execution/
    └───SKILL.md
```

## Usage

To install all the skills from this repository, run the following command:

```bash
gemini skills install https://github.com/pistocop/llm-skills/
```

Once installed, instructions for using each specific skill can be found in the `SKILL.md` file within that skill's directory.

## Contributing

This is a personal collection, but suggestions and ideas are welcome. Feel free to open an issue to discuss potential new skills or improvements.
